# <ins>Geomorphic Zonation Mapping of Mombasa County's Coastal Line using Google Earth Engine</ins>

The increasing vulnerability of coastal ecosystems worldwide necessitates robust methods for understanding and monitoring their spatial characteristics. This project addresses the need for detailed coastal environment mapping by focusing on the geomorphic zonation of the Mombasa County coastline in Kenya. The goal is to develop a comprehensive map of distinct coastal units based on their landform characteristics and the dominant geomorphic processes shaping them. This information is crucial for effective coastal management, hazard assessment, and ecological studies, particularly in regions facing growing pressures from climate change and human development. This overview outlines the methodology and key findings of a Jupyter Notebook designed to achieve this objective using advanced remote sensing techniques and the Google Earth Engine platform.

The study centers on the concept of geomorphic zonation, which, within the context of this project, refers to the spatial delineation of distinct coastal units based on their characteristic landforms and the dominant geological and physical processes shaping them. Understanding geomorphic zonation is fundamental to coastal studies as it provides a framework for analyzing the distribution of habitats, predicting erosion patterns, and assessing the vulnerability of different coastal segments to natural hazards. The diverse coastline of Mombasa County, with its varied geomorphic features, makes it an ideal location for applying and refining geomorphic zonation methodologies. The project aims to provide a detailed classification of these zones, contributing to a better understanding of the region's coastal dynamics.

Several key data sources were integral to this analysis. The Allen Coral Atlas served as a foundational dataset for identifying the existing extent of coral reefs in the region. This global initiative provides valuable baseline information on coral reef distribution and health, which can be further refined with higher-resolution data. PlanetScope imagery provided the necessary high spatial resolution multispectral data for detailed mapping of beaches and other fine-scale coastal features. The high resolution of PlanetScope imagery allows for the identification of subtle variations in coastal morphology that might be missed by coarser resolution datasets. Google Earth Engine facilitated the efficient access, pre-processing, and analysis of these large geospatial datasets, enabling the implementation of complex remote sensing algorithms at scale. The platform's capabilities in handling vast amounts of satellite imagery and performing computationally intensive tasks make it ideal for regional-scale geomorphic zonation mapping.

The study area for this project is the coastal line of Mombasa County, Kenya. This region is ecologically significant, boasting a high biodiversity of coral reefs and supporting the livelihoods of local communities through tourism and fisheries. The coastline is characterized by a diverse range of coastal ecosystems, including extensive fringing reefs along the southern coast, sandy beaches, estuaries that serve as critical nursery habitats for marine species, and low-lying coastal plains. Understanding the geomorphic zonation of this area is crucial for sustainable management of its valuable natural resources and for mitigating the impacts of coastal hazards.

The key geomorphic features identified and mapped in this study include beaches, coral reefs, estuaries, and coastal plains. Beaches are dynamic zones of sandy accumulation along the shoreline, constantly shaped by wave action and sediment transport. Coral reefs are submerged carbonate structures created by the accumulation of coral skeletons, providing habitat for a vast array of marine organisms. Estuaries are transitional environments where freshwater rivers meet the saltwater of the ocean, often supporting unique vegetation such as mangroves and playing a vital role in nutrient cycling and as nursery grounds for many fish and invertebrate species. Coastal plains are low-lying, relatively flat areas adjacent to the sea, often formed by the deposition of sediments over geological time. The spatial distribution and characteristics of these features are critical for understanding the overall coastal environment and its response to various pressures.

The primary purpose of the Jupyter Notebook associated with this project is to map the geomorphic zones of Mombasa County's coastline using the Google Earth Engine platform. The notebook provides a structured workflow encompassing several key steps. It begins with the acquisition and pre-processing of relevant remote sensing data within the Earth Engine environment. This is followed by the implementation of the chosen remote sensing techniques, including the calculation of spectral indices and the application of object-based image analysis. Subsequently, the notebook performs the classification or segmentation of the identified geomorphic zones based on the processed data. Finally, it facilitates the visualization of the resulting geomorphic zone map, either directly within the Earth Engine environment or through the export of the map as a geospatial file for use in other GIS software. The notebook leverages specific Earth Engine functionalities such as ee.ImageCollection for managing satellite imagery and potentially ee.Classifier for implementing classification algorithms. This structured approach allows users to understand and potentially replicate or adapt the methodology for different study areas or geomorphic features.

In conclusion, this project provides a valuable framework for mapping coastal geomorphic zones using freely available remote sensing data and the powerful Google Earth Engine platform. By defining geomorphic zonation, employing appropriate remote sensing techniques, utilizing specific data sources like the Allen Coral Atlas and PlanetScope, focusing on the ecologically and socio-economically important coastline of Mombasa County, and identifying key geomorphic features, this work contributes to a better understanding of coastal environments. The Jupyter Notebook serves as a transparent and reproducible tool for achieving this objective, offering potential for further research, adaptation, and application in coastal management and conservation efforts in Kenya and similar coastal regions worldwide.
